# Operator framework


## CRs, CRDs and Operators

A custom resource (CR) is an extension of the Kubernetes API that is not necessarily available in a default Kubernetes installation. It represents a customization of a particular Kubernetes installation

A Kubernetes Operator is an abstraction for deploying non-trivial applications on Kubernetes. It wraps the logic for deploying and operating an application using Kubernetes constructs. As an example, the Kafka operator provides a Kafka cluster as a first-class object.

Custom resource definitions (CRDs) extend the Kubernetes API, providing definitions to create and modify custom resources to a Kubernetes cluster. Custom resources are created as instances of CRDs.

CRDs require a one-time installation in a cluster. Depending on the cluster setup, installation typically requires cluster admin privileges.

CRDs and custom resources are defined as YAML files.

A CRD defines a new kind of resource, such as **kind: Kafka**, within a Kubernetes cluster.

Operators are implemented as a collection of controllers where each controller watches a specific resource type. When a relevant event occurs on a watched resource a reconcile cycle is started.

During the reconcile cycle, the controller has the responsibility to check that current state matches the desired state described by the watched resource.

## Using an operator for running Kafka on K8S

Install the auxiliary Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), a tool to help manage the Operators running on your cluster.

```console
$ curl -sL https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/download/0.14.1/install.sh | bash -s 0.14.1

deployment "olm-operator" successfully rolled out
deployment "catalog-operator" successfully rolled out
Package server phase: Installing
Package server phase: Succeeded
deployment "packageserver" successfully rolled out
```

Next, install the Strimzi Kafka operator

```console
$ kubectl create -f https://operatorhub.io/install/strimzi-kafka-operator.yaml
subscription.operators.coreos.com/my-strimzi-kafka-operator created
```

To check if the operator has been installed successfully, wait until the PHASE changes into 'Succeeded' (it may take a while).


```console
$ kubectl get csv -n operators  
NAME                               DISPLAY   VERSION   REPLACES   PHASE
strimzi-cluster-operator.v0.17.0   Strimzi   0.17.0               Succeeded
```

One or more CRD/s should have been created by the operator 

```console
$ kubectl get crd
NAME                                          CREATED AT
...
kafkabridges.kafka.strimzi.io                 2020-01-16T22:50:13Z

kafkausers.kafka.strimzi.io                   2020-01-16T22:50:14Z
...
```

If you want to inspect the CRD **kafkas.kafka.strimzi.io**:

```console
$ kubectl get crd kafkas.kafka.strimzi.io -o yaml | more 
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:

```

Now, we are going to implement the following architecture:

![Kafka Operator](img/cluster-operator.png)

To test the operator, we are ready to create a **Kafka** resource, note the `kind: Kafka`

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-kafka-cluster-with-operator
spec:
  kafka:
    version: 2.3.0
    replicas: 1
    ...
```

```console
$ kubectl apply -f kafka-cluster.yaml 
kafka.kafka.strimzi.io/my-kafka-cluster-with-operator created
```

Note that since we installed the operator and its CRDs successfully, we can **get kafka** cluster using kubectl tool

```console
$ kubectl get kafka
NAME                             DESIRED KAFKA REPLICAS   DESIRED ZK REPLICAS
my-kafka-cluster-with-operator   1                        1
```

Get the Kafka pod list:

```console
$ kubectl get po
NAME                                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-kafka-cluster-with-operator-entity-operator-64ff59fdf8-44dkp   3/3     Running   0          60s
my-kafka-cluster-with-operator-kafka-0                            2/2     Running   0          90s
my-kafka-cluster-with-operator-zookeeper-0                        2/2     Running   0          6m9s
```

You can delete the cluster now:

```console
$ kubectl delete kafka my-kafka-cluster-with-operator                 
kafka.kafka.strimzi.io "my-kafka-cluster-with-operator" deleted
```
