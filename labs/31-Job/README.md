# Job


A job in Kubernetes is a supervisor for pods carrying out batch processes, that is, a process that runs for a certain time to completion, for example a calculation or a backup operation.

Let’s create a job called countdown that supervises a pod counting from 9 down to 1:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f job.yaml
job.batch/countdown created
```

You can see the job and the pod  like so:

```console
$ kubectl get jobs
NAME        COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
countdown   1/1           2s         2s
```


```console
$ kubectl get pods
NAME              READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
countdown-xjmhc   0/1     Completed   0          75s
```

To learn more about the status of the job, do:

```console
$ kubectl describe jobs/countdown
Name:           countdown
Namespace:      default
Selector:       controller-uid=18e1ee54-13b3-42ba-b561-42ab030d64bf

                job-name=countdown

  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  2m51s  job-controller  Created pod: countdown-xjmhc
```

And to see the output of the job via the pod it supervised, execute:

```console
$ kubectl logs countdown-xjmhc
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
```

To clean up, use the delete verb on the job object which will remove all the supervised pods:

```console
$ kubectl delete jobs/countdown
job.batch "countdown" deleted
```

Let's try to schedule a CronJob. CronJobs are useful to start a  computation or activity on pre-defined interval.

To try a CronJob resource apply the **cron-job.yaml** config.

```console
$ kubectl apply -f cron-job.yaml
cronjob.batch/hello created
```

To inspect the CronJob schedule:

```console
$ kubectl get cronjob hello
NAME    SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
hello   */1 * * * *   False     0        <none>          15s
```

As you can see from the results of the command, the cron job has not scheduled or run any jobs yet. Watch for the job to be created in around one minute:

```console
$ kubectl get jobs --watch
NAME               COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
hello-1569340620   1/1           4s         65s
hello-1569340680   1/1           4s         5s
```

To delete the CronJob:

```console
$ kubectl delete -f cron-job.yaml
cronjob.batch "hello" deleted
```
