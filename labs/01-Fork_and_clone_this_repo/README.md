When you enter as logged-in user, re-click on **Fork** button at the top-right of the screen. Forking a repository allows you create a copy of the original repo on your GitHub account so as to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

In the following command, please make sure to change \<YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT\> placeolders accordingly:

- \<YOUR PREFERRED FOLDER\> with the folder you want to clone this repo into

```
$ cd <YOUR PREFERRED FOLDER>
$ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT>/ITS-ICT_Containers
```
